### What I Learned

My very first time handling API with so many query parameters + CORS Policy. First few hours was confused because i can't access the API but with the help of Postman and Moesif CORS Extension on chrome i can access the API like any other. I just received 2 API that fetched everything within the database and have to go through all that data manipulation for fetching single data, searching title, and searching by authors thats pretty challenging. The other part is having to design the website on my own. The design was basically copied from the SejutaCita Booku Android App simplified
